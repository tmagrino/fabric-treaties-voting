# Examples configuration properties.


# JDK installation directory
#
# This is optional. If not set, then the following values are used, in
# order of precedence:
#
#   1. The jdk.home property from config.properties in Jif's source
#      tree. (This does not exist when using Jif from a jar file.)
#
#   2. The JAVA_HOME environment variable.
#
#   3. The output of the following BASH command (if successful):
#
#          readlink -f $(which javac) \
#            | sed '/\/bin\/javac$/{s|/bin/javac$||;q}; q1'
#
#      (The above sed expression is the same as 's|/bin/javac$||',
#      except it returns with exit code 1 if the substitution is
#      unsuccessful.)
#
#   4. Ant's built-in java.home property (on some systems, this points
#      to the JRE, and not the JDK).
#
# The commented example below uses Ant's built-in java.home property.

#jdk.home=${java.home}


# Jif installation directory
#
# This is optional. By default, the copy of Jif included in the Fabric
# distribution is used.

#jif.home=${env.HOME}/jif


# Polyglot installation directory
#
# This is optional. By default, the copy of Polyglot included in the
# Fabric distribution is used.

#polyglot.home=${env.HOME}/polyglot

# Fabric installation directory
fabric.home=${env.HOME}/work/fabric
